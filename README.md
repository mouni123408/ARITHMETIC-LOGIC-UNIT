DESCRIPTION:
            THE ARITHEMETIC LOGIC UNIT(ALU) IS A CORE COMPONENT OF ANY DIGITAL COMPUTING SYSTEM.IT PERFORMS THE ESSENTIAL ARITHMETIC AND LOGICAL OPERATIONS REQUIRED FOR DATA PROCESSING IN MICROPROCESSORS,MICROCONTROLLERS,AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS.THIS PROJECT FOCUS ON THE DESIGN,IMPLEMENTATION,AND SIMULATION OF A BASIC ALU USING HARWARE DESCIPTION LANGUAGES SUCH AS VERILOG OR VHDL.THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE A SIMPLE YET FUNCTION ALU CAPABLE OF EXECUTING OPERATIONS INCLUDING ADDITON,SUBTRACTION,BITWISE AND,BITWISE OR AND BITWISE NOT.
            IN DIGITAL SYSTEMS,THE ALU IS CONTROLLED BY A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS OR OPCODES THAT DETERMINE WHICH OPERATION TO PERFORM.FOR THIS PROJECT,THE ALU IS DESIGNED TO ACCEPT TWO PRIMARY INPUTS (A AND B),A CONTROL SIGNAL,AND PRODUCE AN OUTPUT BASED ON THE SELECTED OPERATION.EACH OPERATION IS MAPPED TO A SPECIFIC OPCODE,AND THE ALU PERFORMS THE OPERATION ACCORDINGLY.THE DATA WIDTH FOR THE ALU IN THIS DESIGN CAN BE CHOSEN AS 4-BIT OR 8-BIT,DEPENDING ON SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND SIMUATION CONSTRAINTS.
            IN CONCLUSION,THIS ALU DESIGN PROJECT DEMONSTARTES THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF DIGITAL DESIGN AND HDL PROGRAMMING.IT PROVIDES HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE IN DESIGNING A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ANT PROCESSOR AND GIVES INSIGHT INTO HOW ARITHMETIC AND OGIC OPERATIONS ARE HANDLED AT THE HARDWARE LEVEL.
